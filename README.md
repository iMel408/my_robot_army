finally building my evil robot army. muahahaha! 
aka - getting some badly needed practice building/learning how to structure classes.

in the end, i'd like to be able to build robots with different roles, subroles and assign them to different skirmishes with in a larger battle.
also want to be able to build an inventory and report on unit statuses, condition to eventually automate the building of reinforcemnts based on where and what roles are are needed in battle.

i know, i know... i should have listened to everyones advice and just stuck with building a 'car' or 'animal' class on my first go, but i just really wanted to play with robots and assign them cooool names.... :(
i see why people suggested simple structures though. i already get the sense i've bitten more than i can chew. way too many ideas popping in my head that i'll probably never finish...
